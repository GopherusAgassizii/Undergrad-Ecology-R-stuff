Lab #2
Lab Partners: Margaret Moran, Patience, Ann
Objective: extract DNA from collected soil
samples:
1123 - C3@
1123 - C3&
1123 - C3#
1123 - K6#
1123 - K6@
1123 - K6&

step 1: put 800 microliters of solution CD1 then 250 mg of soil into powerbead pro tube
  we used the 100-1000 microliter pipette on the 800 setting. We then used a chem wipe with 80%
  ethanol for the spatula. We labled tubes as 1123 - C3 and 1123 - K6, we continued to use this 
  tube name for future tubes as well.

step 2: Use jiggler to seperate dirt and DNA

step 3: centrufuge the powerbead pro tube at 15,000 x g for 1 min

step 4: transfer supernatant to a clean 2ml microcentrufuge tube.
  we had Patience do the first tube then Ann did the second wirh 100-1000 pipette. 

step 5: add 200 microliters of sokution CD2 and vortex for 5 seconds
  Maragret pipetted the 200 microliters of CD2 with 100-1000 pipette.

step 6: centrufuge at 15,000 x g for 1 min at room temp. avoiding the pellet, transfer up to 700
  microliters of supernatant to a clean 2 ml microcentrifuge tube
  patience and i centrifuged it then patience transfered it to the tube

step 7: add 600 microliters of solution CD3 and vortex for 5 seconds
  I pipetted the 600 microliters then we vortexed. It was hard to get enough CD3 becaue the vials 
  we had were too small for 1200 microliters of CD3.

step 8: load 650 microliters of the lysate onto an MB Spin Column ans centrifuge at 15000 x g for
1 min
  Margaret pipetted then Patience centrifuged.

step 9: discard the flowhtrough and repeat step 8 to ensure that all of the lysate has passed through
the MB spin column 
  Patience discarded the flow through then Margaret pipetted again.

step 10: Carefully place the MB Spin column into a clean 2 ml Collection Tube. avoid splashing any
flow through onto the MB spin column
  Patience put it into the collection tube.

step 11: add 500 microliters of solution to the MB spin column. Centrifuge at 15000 x g for 1 min.
  Patience pipetted and centrifuged.

step 12: Discard flow through and place MB Spin Column into same 2ml collection tube 
  Patience put it into the collection tube 

step 13: add 500 microliters of solution to the MB spin column. Centrifuge at 15000 x g for 1 min.
  I pipetted it into rhe spun column and Parience centrifuged for a minute.

step 14: Discard flow through and place MB Spin Column into same 2ml collection tube
  Patience  discarded flow.

15: Centrifuge at up to 16000 x g for 2 minutes. Carefully place the MB Spin Column into a new 
1.5 ml Elution tube 
  Patience centrifuged for 2 minutes and out it into thr elution tube.

16. Add 50-100 microliters of Solution C6 to the center of the white filter membrane
  Ann grabbed a 20-200 pipette and pipetted C6 to the filter membrane.

17. Centrifuge at 15000 x g for 1 min. Discard the MB Spin Column. The DNA is now ready for
downstream applications.
  Parience centrifuged it
