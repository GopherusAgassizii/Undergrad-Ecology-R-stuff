Lab #5
Lab Partners: Patience, Margaret, and Thiego 
Objective: extract DNA for invasive plants from soil samples for MIGHT #2 and WITHOUT #2

Samples: 
K1160-B2@
K1160-B2&
K1160-B2#
K1160-A1@
K1160-A1&
K1160-A1#

Lab Summary:
1. Spin the PowerBead Pro Tube briefly to ensure that the beads have settled at the bottom.
Add up to 250 mg of soil and 800 μl of Solution CD1. Vortex briefly to mix.
  Margaret added soil.

2. Use a PowerLyzer 24 Homogenizer. PowerBead Pro Tubes must be properly
balanced in the tube holder of the PowerLyzer 24 Homogenizer. We recommend
homogenizing the soil at 2000 rpm for 30 s, pausing for 30 s, then homogenizing
again at 2000 rpm for 30 s.
  We chose this step(2b) over vortexing for 10 minutes. It is in page 13-14 of the detailed lab protocol for powersoil. I 
  Accidentally did not label both tubes on the side but did on the top. Thankfully it did not get fully wiped off on the top
  and we were still able to differentiate between the samples. I learned an important lesson and won't repeat that mistake again.

3. Centrifuge the PowerBead Pro Tube at 15,000 x g for 1 min.
  Thiego centrifuged.

4. transfer the supernatant to a clean 2 ml Microcentrifuge Tube (provided).
Note: Expect 500–600 μl. The supernatant may still contain some soil particles.
  I transferred it with a pipette. Thiego helped me work on my pipette skills. 

5. Add 200 μl of Solution CD2 and vortex for 5 s
  I pipetted the CD2 in.

6.Centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 1 min. Avoiding the pellet, transfer up to 700 μl of
supernatant to a clean 2 ml Microcentrifuge Tube (provided).
  Thiego centrifuged. I believe Margaret pipetted. 

7. Add 600 μl of Solution CD3 and vortex for 5 s.
  Patience vortexed

8. Load 650 μl of lysate to an MB Spin Column. Centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 1 min.
  I pipetted and Thiego centrifuged

9.Discard the flow-through and repeat step 8 to ensure that all of the lysate has passed
through the MB Spin Column
  Thiego handeled this

10. Carefully place the MB Spin Column into a clean 2 ml Collection Tube (provided). Avoid
splashing any flow-through onto the MB Spin Column.
  Thiego handled this

11. Add 500 μl of Solution EA to the MB Spin Column. Centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 1 min
  I think Patience pipetted this one and Thiego centrifuged. 

12. Discard the flow-through and place the MB Spin Column back into the same 2 ml
Collection Tube
  Thiego handled this.

13. Add 500 μl of Solution C5 to the MB Spin Column. Centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 1 min
  I pipetted and Thiego centrifuged. 

14. Discard the flow-through and place the MB Spin Column into a new 2 ml Collection
Tube (provided)
  Thiego handled this.

15. Centrifuge at up to 16,000 x g for 2 min. Carefully place the MB Spin Column into a
new 1.5 ml Elution Tube (provided)
  Thiego handled this.

16. Add 50–100 μl of Solution C6 to the center of the white filter membrane.
  Margaret pippetted this.

17. Centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 1 min. Discard the MB Spin Column. The DNA is now
ready for downstream applications
  Thiego handled this. I then labeled ours as 
MIGHT #2

The other tube I labeled as
