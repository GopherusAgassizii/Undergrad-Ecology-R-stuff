Lab #9
Lab Partners: Anne, Gwen
Lab Objective: assemble data from species to make a tree for project

Notes: We had to use public data because the qpcr did not work. We went on ncbi and looked under nucleotides for green crab
filtered for mitochondria. We used the first sequence that popped up. 

Step 1: Downloaded the NOVOPlasty zip file in order to use that program for creating our genome.
  I downloaded it from this link https://github.com/ndierckx/NOVOPlasty To note I pressed the green code button and copied link address
  to the zip file. I did not just press the copy to clipboard button. I then used command wget followed by the link.

Step 2: unzip the NOVOPlasty by using command "unzip master.zip"

Step 3: I created a directory called Greencrab to store my stuff in.

Step 4: I created a config.txt file by copying the config.txt file from https://github.com/ndierckx/NOVOPlasty.

step 5: I created symbolic links to the .q files using ln -s. 

step 6: I made a fasta file by getting a mitochondrial sequence from NCBI.

Step 6: I edited the config.txt file by adding in the paths to my symbolic links and putting the name of the fasta file for inputs. I
deleted chloroplast section. 

Step 7: Run the Novoplasty with command "perl /NOVOPlasty4.3.5.pl -c config.txt"

Update: Found out on Thursday that Patience and her group that was working on green crab got their file to run completely. Mine was still runnning when I left lab.
