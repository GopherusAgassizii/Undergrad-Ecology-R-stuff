Practicing Pipetting

#notes from lab briefing by TA
For using a pipette you want to make sure the volume is in the middle of the range of the pipette. DO NOT use something out of range. 
Make sure that the tips fit the propper size for the pippette. For example don't use a 1000 mL tip for a 20-100 mL pipette. 
NEVER touch the tip with your hand to remove it. Gently press down on the tip with the pipette to get it in the pipette and use the button to remove the tip.

#Q1
What pipetter might you use to pipette 400 microliters?
the 200-1000 microliters pipette
#Q2
How might you pipette 400 microliters with a P100
Pipette 100 microliters 4 times.
#Try it activity 1
Directions: Pipette 87.3 microliters into a weighing boat and weigh.
We used the 20-200 microliter UC0119SC to pipette 87.3 microliters of water.
We got 0.07, 0.05, 0.04, and 0.06. Expected value was 0.0873 g
We pipetted incorrectly for a few trials because we did not press down after feeling resistance but even in the 'correct trials' we got values off from the expected value.
Either we need to work on our pipetting skills or the pipette is not correctly calibrated

#Repeat Activity 1 with 1 microliter
It did not register it on the scale but the scale only goes to the 100ths place so this would be expected considering the expected value is 0.001 grams.
