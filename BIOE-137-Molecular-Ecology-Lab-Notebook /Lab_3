Lab #3
Lab Partners: Patience and Margaret
Objective: Use Geneious and NCBI to figure our what our unkown blob is 

#Q1
Given that we know nothing about our lump of flesh, what kind of marker should we choose to 
target in this experiment. 
  We should use DNA barcodes for animals. There are plenty available online to be able to narrow
  down what taxa the unkown blob is from. Barcodes are highly conserved regions among taxa. For 
  example you would expect that lizards would all have regions of their genome that they would
  all have the same sequence for because they are all related. 

#Q2
