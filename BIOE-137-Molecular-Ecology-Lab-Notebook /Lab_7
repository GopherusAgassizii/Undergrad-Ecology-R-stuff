Lab #7
Lab Partners: Patience
Lab Objective: Familiarize yourself with how to build a mitochondrial genome in linux

Step 1: We familiarized ourselves with how to use linux commands. I created a file in my personal directory called Bioe137 to store this in

Step 2: Downloaded the NOVOPlasty zip file in order to use that program for creating our genome.
  I downloaded it from this link https://github.com/ndierckx/NOVOPlasty To note I pressed the green code button and copied link address
  to the zip file. I did not just press the copy to clipboard button. I then used command wget followed by the link.

Step 3: unzip the NOVOPlasty by using command "unzip master.zip"

Step 4: change directories into Novoplasty-master by command "cd Novoplasty-master". I then moved to test datasets with "cd Test\ datasets/"
Change directories to mito assembly with "cd Mitochondrial\ assembly/"

Step 5: unzip the .gz files with command "gunzip Homo_sapiens_R2.fasta.gz" and "gunzip Homo_sapiens_R1.fasta.gz"

Step 6: Change the files in the config file to match our newly unzipped files. Used command "nano config_mito_test.txt" Then I deleted the
.gz at the end of Homo_sapiens_R1.fasta.gz and Homo_sapiens_R2.fasta.gz 

Step 7: Run the Novoplasty with command "perl ../../NOVOPlasty4.3.5.pl -c config_mito_test.txt"
