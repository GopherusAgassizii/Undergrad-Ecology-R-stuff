Objective: Learn how to use computational tools for describing a populations structure

Q1 Formulate a hypothesis regarding how many populations you expect to see.
Explain your reasoning
  After looking at how the roads bisect the Geography of California I would predict that the turtles are in 9 populations. Even though
  there are many more dots than 9 I know from personal experience that western pond turtles(I've done trapping for USGS to tag and
  collect DNA samples)can travel incredibly far, especially male ones. That being said I doubt they are successfully travelling over 
  roads. I know from experience with desert tortoises that any time a road is placed it prevents gene flow and extirpates all the 
  tortoises in the nearby area. My groups are based on where the roads are. Any dots not disrupted by a road I count as one population.
