Goal: do qpcr on Elodea samples
We were group 3 and had the dilution of elodea.

Step 1: Make Mix for 18 PCR wells. We make enough for 19 to account for error.
Formula:
DNA - 5 microliters 
Master Mix - 12.5 microliters x 19 = 237.5 microliters
Probe - 1 microliters x 19 = 19 microliters
H20 - 6.5 microliters x 19 = 123.5 microliters

236.5 + 19 + 123.5 = 380 microliters

Step 2: put the mix and DNA into tubes. 
3 wells at a time so each tube should have (20 from mix x 3) + (5 DNA x 3) = 75 microliters of mix and DNA

Step 3: make dilutions for DNA.
  We added 20 microliters of DNA in the first tube. Took 2 from it and added to the next along with 18 microliters water. Repeated this step twice.
  After this we had a concentration of 1, 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000

Step 4: add aquatic meta environment and water into remaining two tubes
we added 15 microliters aquatic metaenvironment in one tube and 15 microliters water in another tube.
Our pipettes were definetly off and we were under for the 1/100th dilution & water & aquatic metaenvironment

*note: We vortexed each time we added DNA to the mix.

Step 5: Pipette into PCR wells.
We pipetted 25 microliters into each well. We started at the last column were we added sample of 1 concentration, then another sample 1 concentration under it, then again under that one. We then moved
to the next column and did the same for 1/10th concentration. Repeated this step for 1/100th, 1/1000th, water, and aquatic metaenvironment.
