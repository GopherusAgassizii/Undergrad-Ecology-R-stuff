Lab #5
Lab Partners: Patience and Margaret 
Objective: extract DNA for invasive plants.
Sample: 6
Team name: The sinister six

Step 0:
Get ice and set up racks on ice for PCR tubes and for microcentrifuge tubes.

Step 1: Put <100 ng DNA in a total volume of 26 uL in a PCR strip tube or loose tube

Step 2: Thaw ultra II FS Reaction Bugger and place on ice until use. 

Step 3: Take out enzyme mix, vortex, and add this amount of bugger and enzyme mix on ice;

Step 4: Add 7uL buffer and 2uL enzyme to the 26 uL DNA in the tube over ice. Close and vortex. Immediately incubate in the thermocycler for 10 min at 37 deg with heated lid set to 75 deg, followed by 30 min at 65 deg, hold
4 deg indefinetly.
  Steps 1-4 were done by Professor Meyer. She accidentally added 5 uL of bugger before enzyme but corrected it by adding 2uL in. 

Step 5: Take Y- adapters diluted 10 - fold to make a working concentration of 1.5uM (for the class, need only 10 libs of adapters) and mix them on the vortex and keep thawed on ice. Also take out the NEBNext Ultra II ligation
Master Mix and pipette up and down to mix. 
  Patience did this step

Step 6: Take the reaction mixture from Step 4 and add 30 uLNEBNExt Ultra II ligation master mix, 1uL LIgation Enhancer, 2.5uL our homemade Y- adapters. Total volume is 68.5uL. Set a 100 uL pipette to the 50 uL and then
pipette the entire volume up and down at least 10 times to mix thoroughly. Perform a quick spin to collect all liquid from the sides of the tube. 
  Patience did this step

Step 7. Incubate at 20 degrees C for 15 minutes in a thermocycler with heated lid off.
  We did this with everyone's samples at once

Step 8. Bead cleaning the 68.5 uL adapter ligated fragments by adding 48 uL of resuspended bead solution to the gragments. Mix by pipetting 10 times, incubate 5 min (at least, maybe 5-10 min) at room temperature, then place
on magnet 1 min, then remove clear liquid, wash beads with 80% ethanol twice, and add 25 uL water after they dry and incubate room temp for 5 minutes. Place beads on the magnet 5 min and transfer 20uL water to a new
tube carefully avoiding disturbance to the beads
  Patience did the ligated fragments and added the bead solution that Margaret prepared. Patience Mixed it with pipetting. We waited 5 minutes then I put it on the magnet. Margaret and Patience prepared the 80% ethanol
  with 20ml ethanol and 5 ml water. I washed the beads with the ethanol twice. Then Margaret added the water. Margaret then after the 5 min got the 20 uL and mistakenly put it in the pipette disposal bin. We then told 
  Professor Meyer and went to get the last 5uL of water to see if any DNA was left but a ghost took it! We never found the remaining 5 uL water. :(

Step 9: Take the 20uL of adapter ligated fragments that you just cleaned adn add 25 uL NEBNext Ultra II Q5 Master Mix and 5uL index ( unique to each tube). Close and vortext tube, place in thermocycler.
  did not get to this step :(
Step 10: Run indexing PCR accoding to the official protocol
  did not get to this step :(
Step 11: run another bead cleaning at 0.9x (45 uL)
  did not get to this step :(
